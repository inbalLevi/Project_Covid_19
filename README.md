# project_covid_19

## Part 1
I started this part by getting the relevant information from a relevant API and exploring it.

I created different routes that get the wanted country from the query and run the main function which analyzes the data.

## Part 2
Unfortunately I came into some trouble trying download and install Docker and Jenkins that were necessary for this part.

After I finally succeeded download them things didn't go well when trying to run the pipeline in the Jenkins server, probably cause of configuration issues that i wasn't fully able to understand.

Inspite of those difficulties, I did write a jenkins file which I belive is good, but I wasn't able to test it myself following the issues mentioned above.

*important to mention that in the final stage in the pipeline, the script I wrote will only support a single country input, as I didn't manage to find a solution to a list input.
